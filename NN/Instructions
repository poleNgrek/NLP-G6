To run the Syntactic Parser we need to provide it with 8 arguments.
1)The training english corpus
2)The test english corpus
3)The training swedish corpus
4)The test swedish corpus
5)Number of training samples
6)Number of epochs
7)Option -0 for perceptron parser/ -1 for neural networkor parser
8)Option -0 for basic features/ -1 for advanced features

The application will automatically produce projectivized corpuses both for training and testing treebanks.
The projectivized corpus will be saved in the "data" folder while the scores will be saved in the "output" folder.

An example execution is the following:
	python3 app.py data/en-ud-train-projective.conllu data/en-ud-train.conllu data/sv_lines-ud-train.conllu data/sv_lines-ud-train.conllu 500 2 1 1

Or just run:
    	python3 app.py

To run the program with its default settings.

* Use of usual conllu files for training and testing from **data** folder

* 2 epochs

* 500 samples

* Neural Network parser

* Improved features
